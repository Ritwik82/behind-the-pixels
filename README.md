# 🖼️ Behind the Pixels

This file looks like an ordinary image.

But appearances can be deceiving.

Something else lies beneath the surface — unseen by the naked eye,  
yet recoverable by those who know how to look beyond file extensions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Your goal is to uncover the hidden secret inside the image and retrieve the flag.

This challenge rewards careful inspection, proper tooling,  
and familiarity with real-world password auditing techniques.

---

## 🛠️ What You May Need

- File inspection skills  
- Archive analysis  
- Offline password cracking  
- Wordlists and auditing tools  

Guessing blindly will not help.

## 🧠 Hint

> The protection used here is common,  
> and the key to it is not unique — many have used it before.
